            <p>
                Between May 2020 and May 2022, I seasonally worked as a raft guide at
                the U.S. National Whitewater Center, the world's largest artificial 
                whitewater river. Don't let the term "artificial" fool you,
                these rapids were just as intense as the wild; this is where
                tryouts are held for the Olympics. Halfway through my first season I
                was promoted to Trip Lead, which put me in charge of the flotilla of 
                rafts running each trip.
            </p>
            <p>
                I am extremely proud of my time as a guide; it taught me confidence
                and resilience during a time when I had none.
                Guiding people through an intimidating experience and seeing their
                fear turn to joy is the most rewarding feeling in the world.
            </p>
            <p>
                While I ultimately had to move on, rafting has given me strength under
                pressure and the confidence needed to succeed in chaotic environments.

            I had a lot of unique crews; here are some of my favorites:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Four super buff construction workers.
                Fully utilizing their power, I got them absolutely soaked and they were giggling like kids.
            </li>
            <li>
                A crew consisting of one Australian, two Scots, one Englishman, and one Chicagoan.
                They were a hoot.
            </li>
            <li>
                A hispanic family of whom only one spoke English.
                Instead of making her translate the entire time, I had them teach me how to say
                the rafting commands in Spanish; we had a blast.
            </li>
            <li>
                Bachelor/bachelorette parties were always fun. I even had one sweet sixteen.
            </li>
            <li>
                One family who came several times and would always request me.
                It was awesome to see the kids' confidence grow every time.
                (They're front row in the video below)
            </li>
            <li>
                A deaf man; it honestly wasn't a big challenge and he was a super strong
                paddler, but it was still rewarding to help increase accessibility of the sport.
            </li>
        </ul>
