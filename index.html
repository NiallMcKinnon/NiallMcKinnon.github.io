        This is a very early draft of my personal portfolio.
        While it's quite rough, I still wanted a visual aid for the projects listed on my resume.
        This site is my first forray into web design, so massive changes/improvements will come.
        However, I am currently enrolled full-time as well as working a full-time internship,
        which leaves little room for personal projects.

            The goal of this project is to perform GPS-denied navigation and terrain mapping,
            demonstrating applications for the Moon and Mars.
            This rover is equipped with a Frequency-Modulated Continuous Wave (FMCW) LiDAR
            scanner, which has the ability to determine its position and velocity soley by
            referencing its immediate surroundings.
        </p>
        <p>
            The application is based on Robot Operating System and its Navigation 2 library, both open-source.
            Navigation 2 was originally developed for use in structured environments such as warehouses
            and hospitals.
            Thus, this project pushes the bounderies of Navigation 2 due to our focus on unstructured environments
            and uneven terrain.

            This was an introductory robotics course taught at UNCW. I took the inagural offering of the course.
            The project goal was to detect an object in 3D space and have a robot manipulator arm
            move said object.
        </p>
        <p>
            The bulk of programming was done in Python within the Robot Operating System framework.
            This course served as an introduction to Robot Operating System, Linux, and Docker.
